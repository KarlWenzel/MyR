# Linear Regression and Multivariable Regression

We now extend linear regression so that our models can contain more variables. A natural first approach is to assume additive effects, basically extending our line to a plane, or generalized version of a plane as we add more variables. Multivariable regression represents one of the most widely used and successful methods in statistics.
